​4. The Compound Separator: Simulated Bleaching
​Once the bulk vapor and solids are removed, the oil still contains dissolved chemical impurities (FFA and Glycerol).
​Engineering Reason: We use a Compound Separator to simulate a Bleaching Earth Treatment Unit. By "stripping" 
the Oleic Acid from the stream, we reach the Regenerated Oil 
Purity target of <1% FFA, making the oil chemically safe to return to the food-production cycle.
