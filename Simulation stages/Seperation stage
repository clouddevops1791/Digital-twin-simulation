​3. The Multi-Phase Separation Stage: SVLE Logic
​After the reactor, the stream contains vapor (steam), liquid (oil), and solids (starch).
​Solid Separation (Starch1): The reactor is configured to divert the 450 K solids immediately. This prevents burnt fines from re-circulating, 
which would otherwise accelerate oil rancidity.
​Gas-Liquid Separator (V-1): The remaining stream enters a Flash vessel.
​Engineering Reason: Operating at approximately 202,057 Pa, this vessel strips the high-pressure water vapor from the liquid oil. High water 
content in recycled oil leads to "foaming" 
and equipment corrosion; removing it here is a prerequisite for a high-purity recycle loop.
