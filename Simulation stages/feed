​1. The Feed & Mixing Stage: Establishing the Baseline
​The process begins at the Mixer (MIX-1), where a complex feed—consisting of fresh Palm Olein oil and the "Washed & Sliced Potato" stream (50% Dry Matter at 298 K)—is homogenized.
​Engineering Reason: In a continuous frying operation, the feed must be precisely balanced. By utilizing a mixer before the reactor, we simulate the "makeup" oil required to replace what is absorbed by the product, 
ensuring the system reaches a steady-state mass balance necessary for the 20% oil reduction target.
